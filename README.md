# Generative Art

Project for Computational Arts-based Reasearch and Theory.

Rita Cabrito, Chris Newth, Armando Gonzalez.

This website was developed using the TypeScript language, a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript, which adds types and other features to the core JavaScript language.
The UI and navigation were developed using React.js and other accompanying libraries.
The animations are presented using p5.js, a JavaScript (and in this case, TypeScript), port of Processing.
The website is hosted on Heroku.
The repository for this website can be found on GitHub, and youâ€™re invited to explore the repository and its code.
