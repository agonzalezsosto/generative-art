      We live in a time where the web presents an almost universal platform for
      devices of varying characteristics to engage in a somewhat similar
      experience. This presents an interesting opportunity to the contemporary
      artist. These modern technologies can be leveraged in order to provide an
      artistic experience to audiences throughout the world, providing fertile
      ground for artistic and theoretical exploration.

      It’s important to note that websites not only handle the issue of delivery
      and compatibility, as they’re also an interactive means of distribution.
      This means that audiences can continuously engage with the material that
      is being sent to them.

      It is our intention that by providing real-time renderings of generative
      animations, audiences will be able to see how these pieces develop by
      controlling parameters and viewing variations of random processes. It
      seems that the combination of text and real-time renderings of art pieces,
      in combination with static images and other conventional forms of
      multimedia as well, the ideas of generative art can be communicated with
      clarity and transparency.
