      What makes artists interested in generative art? What sort of outcome are
      they expecting by yielding control to external systems? How does the
      artist reconcile their artistic will with the deterministic outcome of a
      programmed system? What is revealed about art itself by working with
      generative art?

      To pave the way for our explorations, we have decided to fragment our
      research into different categories, each of which is accessible on the
      navigation bar on the top of this website.

    <Body>
      In the{' '}
      <b>
        <em>History </em>
      </b>{' '}
      tab, we explore the evolution of generative processes in the creation of
      art pieces. This exploration is aimed at contextualizing the development
      of the field, and it is also an exercise in de-coupling the idea of
      generative processes from computational processes.

    <Body>
      In the{' '}
      <b>
        <em>Randomness</em>
      </b>{' '}
      tab, we explore different usages of randomness and noise in the generation
      of artistic pieces, and how the usage of unexpected values can cause
      intriguing results.
    </Body>
    <Body>
      In the{' '}
      <b>
        <em>Data-Driven </em>
      </b>
      tab, we explore the importance of data in generative art. How by gathering
      simple information we can create engaging artworks by visualizing this
      data.

    <Body>
      In the{' '}
      <b>
        <em>Emergence</em>
      </b>{' '}
      tab, we explore the notion of emergence, in other words, the creation of
      complex behaviors and entities born out of the interaction of simpler
      entities within a system.
    </Body>
    <Body>
      In the
      <b>
        <em>Botanical Systems</em>
      </b>
      tab, we explore how recursion, fractals, L-Systems, and biological systems
      at large can influence the development of algorithms applied to visual
      arts. We also explore the implications of deriving algorithms from
      biological systems.
