        Generative art has always been present, so what keeps making it so
        relevant? What is the fascination behind the lack of control, the use of
        randomness, and interaction?

        Shirazeh Houshiary is an installation artist that focuses on the idea of
        chance, chaos, and lack of control, the arbitrary versus the
        intentional. A world of chaos and movement, where she can combine
        precision (artist’s input) with chaos (the chance of the material). It
        is about the fusion of the precise which is my own marking, with
        something that is very chaotic.{' '}

        The use of these (generative) methods, allow artists to create more
        organic work, work that is closer to Nature – an emergence system. By
        using such structures, the artist can produce work that is made from
        biological processes without intentionally or unintentionally
        manipulating cultural influences.

        As humans, we are constantly trying to understand Nature, our Planet,
        the Universe. I suppose because we do not know so much about our
        surroundings, we have the constant desire to try to find ways to
        replicate these systems that we can’t yet understand. The fascination
        for the unknown, for what is too intricate to comprehend. The use of
        generative art, the use of emergence and randomness, perhaps helps to
        bring us closer to mimicking some properties of this organic behaviour
        and become closer to it.

        To consider how generative art can be enduring, we can perhaps look at
        how other modern artworks can be enduring. In Sonic Placemaking (Jordan
        Lacey, Sonic Placemaking, 2016), the article looks at successful,
        enduring sound art installations that are embraced and valued by
        visitors. The research showed that “each of the creators exhibited deep
        relationships with their chosen sites of intervention” and that “the
        creators are able to augment a pre-existing ‘spirit of place’, which
        informs the ‘life’ of the installation”. So, maybe an enduring
        generative artwork also needs to establish a connection and resonance
        with its surroundings and it’s audience rather than just creating a
        sense of mystery, surprise, wonder etc (as previously alluded to and
        defined). And, maybe where the artwork sits, within us and within our
        world / environment, can make it enduring and relevant. This is perhaps
        why the flocking algorithms and patterns still work - As we, as humans,
        as part of nature and it’s ecosystem, have a primal connection to birds,
        fish and continue to be amazed by, and immersed in, the natural world.
        We want to understand it, be part of it and simulate it. The article
        also discusses how an elemental approach (using wind, water, air, etc)
        to a sound installation can make it successful and enduring, linking in
        with our theme of using nature (and inspirations from nature) for
        generative art.

        Another line of inquiry or thought, is this - Does it matter if
        computational generative art is short lived? For example, sand artist /
        land artist Jon Foreman “choses to see the beauty in his work’s short
        lifespan”. He says, “I create using material that is made from that
        environment for that environment. The tide washes it all back to the
        tide line, and I come back the next day with an empty canvas to work
        with …....If anything the fact that it's short-lived makes it more
        special to me.” (Land Artist Surprises Beach Goers By Leaving Striking
        Stone Arrangements Along the Coast, 2020). Although Foreman’s sand art
        is not necessarily generative (although generative patterns will appear
        as tide and wind interact with it), it is possibly a reminder that
        computational generative art does not necessarily need to be enduring to
        have impact, agency and relevance.
