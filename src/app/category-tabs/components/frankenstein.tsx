        Generative art is an example of emergence, so this is a good starting
        point for categorising it. In the article (leon.2009.42.5.476) we learn
        about categories such as Subjective Emergence and Objective Emergence
        and Frankenstein Emergence (more on that later). The article was written
        in 1999, but the categories seem logical and, at least to me, relevant
        today. In the definition of Subjective Emergence there is reference to
        'surprise' i.e. something unexpected and surprising has emerged. The
        need for 'surprise' is later on included as a 'must have' for generative
        art. In the definition of Objective Emergence the author cites the
        difficulty of predicting the outcome / emergence and how simple rules
        can lead to complex behaviour. This implies a sense of mystery. The need
        for 'mystery' is later on included as a 'must have' for generative art.
