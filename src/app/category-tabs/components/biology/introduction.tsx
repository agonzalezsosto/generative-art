        References to biology and botany have a noticeable presence in the
        context of generative art. The application of concepts like L-systems,
        fractal recursion, and flocking algorithms suggest a strong relationship
        between generative art and biological and bio-algorhythmic observations.
        Why is this the case? Why does it matter? How can these ideas be
        incorporated into our arts practice? What artistic and intellectual
        potential is there when combining these fields of study?

        In this tab, we’ll attempt to address some biologically inspired
        generative art systems. We’ll explore how they can manifest, and we’ll
        look at the different implications that these approaches can have in the
        generation of artworks. A constant thread will bind these different
        ideas: can these systems represent artistic thought?
