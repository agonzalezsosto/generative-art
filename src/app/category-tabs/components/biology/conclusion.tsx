        Biology, generative art, and computation have interesting conceptual
        overlaps. When working with a mixture of these three ideas, artists may
        experience a substantial loss of control as to what an outcome may be.
        This is analogous to what working directly with biology (or agriculture)
        itself would be like.{' '}

        If you plant a tree, you may know a lot of what’ll happen, but most
        likely you’ll never know exactly what the tree will look like in months
        from now. This is reminiscent of chaos theory - despite knowing all the
        initial points in a contained system, there’s too many variables to
        quantify so the result will always be somewhat unpredictable. However,
        despite having a loss of resolution in the granularity of the level of
        control an artist might have, the overall form will conform to an
        intention that might’ve been present from the beginning.

        Computers can be seen as having two different potential roles in
        artistic creation, which follow to an extent the taxonomy of generative
        arts as postulated by Boden and Edmonds (Margaret A. Boden and Ernest A.
        Edmonds (2009) What is generative art?)

        Artists can work with computers as reliable "playback" tools that simply
        show you what you're doing. An example of this would be something like
        Photoshop, Premiere - software that always does what you want it to do
        once you've told it what to do, and if it doesn't do what you want it to
        do, then it's a "bug".
      </Body>
      <Body>
        You could also work with computers as unreliable "generative" tools.
        These generative ideas abstract and encapsulate the thought patterns of
        whomever programmed them, and as such, form a certain type of
        collaborative interaction between whomever's using them and whomever
        made them. Examples of this would be custom made generative tools made
        with tools like openFrameworks, Max MSP, etc.
      </Body>
      <Body>
        Boden and Edmonds utilize a much higher granularity in their definitions
        of taxonomies of generative art, but for my personal practice, it seems
        like all categories fit to an extent in these two larger categories.
      </Body>

        Working with the computer as a reliable “playback” tool places artists
        in situations in which they will not encounter a degree of surprise they
        might experience when working with other human beings. Going back to the
        example of a tree - indeed, the tree will never look as we expect it to
        look, but it will be a tree nonetheless. It’s unpredictable to an
        extent, but it is not illogical, and I believe this is one of the
        reasons why the parallel between these two fields can be so strong.
        Working with a system that functions like a tree can help re-introduce a
        degree of reactivity to the creation of works, as the precise output is
        impossible to be predicted fully.

        Humans are chaos machines, in the sense that despite knowing the
        starting point of many attributes of a given person, you will never
        truly know what their motivations are or what their actions will be.
        This can also be compounded with the fact that when working in a
        collaborative context, you’re forced to rethink your perspective
        relative to the actions and decisions taken by your collaborators. If
        your collaborator is a reliable computation machine, this interaction
        that forces you to continuously re-examine your aesthetic reactions is
        absent. This point also opens the debate of whether or not computers can
        be seen as collaborators in an artistic creation - even when they might
        follow opinionated biases encoded by the developers of generative
        systems.
      </Body>
      <Body>
        Working with generative systems essentially creates a heavily
        opinionated tool which invites the artist to react to. The “opinionated”
        part is the nature of the output that will be generated: how much noise,
        how much variation, etc. These concepts are opinions that are fed into
        the development of a project.
      </Body>
      <Body>
        The benefit of working with biologically inspired systems is that they
        allow the opinionated fluctuations to be derived from basic principles
        that are essential to the constitution of the natural world of which we
        are part of. For example, the way in which cells replicate is a
        manifestation of the basic principles that define biological entities in
        our universe. To see this being replicated in art can be as powerful as
        seeing tropes and narrative patterns from literary monomyths being
        applied in cinema, albeit to a more abstract extent.
      </Body>
      <Body>
        Can biologically inspired works of generative art be more than pretty
        pictures? This question seems to be intriguing but I feel that it
        actually falls flat on its face when you realize that it can be applied
        to any conceptual framework or any technological toolkit. Can
        photorealistic works of 19th century art be more than pretty pictures?
        It seems like it is more reliant on the actual work itself than on the
        practices themselves. Biologically influenced artworks can make
        references to the bio-cultural landscape that humans find themselves in,
        and as such can be part of a strong artistic work.
